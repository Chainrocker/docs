On this page you will find all information regarding the Leman Network Upgrade. The Leman Network Upgrade is the next step in the development of Alephium and will bring new functionalities and features to the blockchain.

## Why the Leman Upgrade?

Alephium has been live on mainnet since Nov 8th 2021. The core dev team has since focused on increasing the performance and security of the whole stack, as well as enabling a top-of-the-class dApp developer experience.

After a time on testnet, the Leman Upgrade brings these important improvements to the mainnet. As these changes are significant, the upgrade will introduce new features and changes that are not be backward-compatible, requiring an upgrade of all nodes.

You can find a full write up on the reasoning and implications on the Leman Upgrade (reasoning) [here](https://medium.com/@alephium/announcing-the-leman-network-upgrade-c01a81e65f0e).

As well as an update on the state of preparation for the upgrade itself [here](https://medium.com/@alephium/the-leman-upgrade-2-232e3374abc4).
