## Node and Explorer APIs

Currently, the following API services are maintained. Note that all APIs are rate limited to prevent spam.
* `https://wallet-v15.mainnet.alephium.org` for mainnet with node v1.5.X ([Test](https://wallet-v15.mainnet.alephium.org/infos/version))
* `https://wallet-v15.testnet.alephium.org` for testnet with node v1.5.X ([Test](https://wallet-v15.testnet.alephium.org/infos/version))
* `https://backend-v19.mainnet.alephium.org` for mainnet with explorer backend v1.9.X ([Test](https://backend-v19.mainnet.alephium.org/infos))
* `https://backend-v19.testnet.alephium.org` for testnet with explorer backend v1.9.X ([Test](https://backend-v19.testnet.alephium.org/infos))

As the project is still under active development, all APIs are versioned. Typically, only the latest versions are maintained, but any API upgrades will be announced to the community in advance.
