This page is WIP until our dApps stack is more stable ðŸš§
:::

Our dApps stack is under active development and things change every day. We are working hard on updating our documentation pages as we go. Feel free to ask us on Discord (https://discord.gg/JErgRBfRSB) if you are interested in developing dApps on Alephium and have questions. In the meantime, these are the projects you are most probably interested in:

- dockerized devnet (explorer included): https://github.com/alephium/alephium-stack/tree/master/devnet
- alephium v1.5.0-rc12: https://github.com/alephium/alephium/releases
