In the Getting Started page, you can find out the installation guide as well as some common use cases for the desktop wallet such as managing accounts, transferring assets, etc. For more information on advanced features, please check out the dedicated pages.
Some could consider the desktop wallet slightly less privacy-preserving and secure than the node wallet as it requires you to trust the applicationâ€™s security and is by default connected to a public node. However, you can build the wallet directly from our GitHub repository and use a local node, or even create your wallet completely offline to mitigate some of these risks.
